## _Calculator_

### _Description_

_A type of Calculator app, which can compute provided string with arithmetic expression and count a response for it. Can
work with brackets and variable operators with different priorities.
Uses __[reversal polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)__._

#### And one of ideas is that it is an universal calculator.

_It means that, if you have:_

* _some special type of data, that can be stored in string representation_
* _overloaded operators for it,_

_you can use it with my calculator. You just need to create `Extractor` and `Converter` for it. These are functions with
specific signatures, that you'll pass to constructor for calculator to work. `Extractor` is a function, that extracts a
substring from a position, which contains only your-type single object. And `Converter`
converts it to value type._  
_For example, now it works with default __double__ converter and extractor (written by myself). But when I wanna use it with
__Long Arythmetics__ (some my custom __BigInt__), it'll be maximum easy to use it with Calculator_

_Different types of brackets. Spaces between characters for comfortable input_

### Used:

* _C++ 17_
* _[CMake](https://cmake.org/)_
* _[Google Tests](https://github.com/google/googletest)_
* _[GitHub Actions CI](https://github.com/features/actions)_

### _To run tests:_

0. _You must have GNU 10+ installed_
1. _Move to `Tests` folder `cd Tests`_
2. _You may just run a script `test.sh`_
3. _Or do everything manually_
4. _`rm -rf ./build`_
5. _`cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"`_
6. _`cmake --build build`_
7. _`cd build && ctest`_

### Cases to implement:

* [ ] Minus (as sign and for numbers) (`-2` and `6 - (5 + 6)`)
* [ ] Chain of pows (2^2^2^2)
* [ ] Brackets
* [x] The idea of converters for different types of numbers (one default and other can be for my custom types)
* [x] The idea of extractors for different types of numbers
* [x] Make it work as template or constructor params
* [ ] Copy constructor, Move Constructor, operators
* [x] Write about extractors and converters concept to this Readme
* [ ] Refactor
