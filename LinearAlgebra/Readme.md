## Simple Linear Algebra Library
###### Educational projects for practice & portfolio | Educational purposes


### _Description:_
_The first project in my C++ Repo.   
Hope not the last :)  
Project's aim — to repeat some linear algebra topics, code them and practice modern C++ with STL, lambdas and so on_



### _Functionality / To Do:_

// Make Matrix as friend class for Vector

- [x] __Vector Class__
    - [x] Template
    - [x] Copy constructor and = operator
      - [x] Tests

      - [x] Tests
    - [ ] Convert / Transform (with lambda as argument)
    - [x] Sum
    - [x] Friend class for Matrix class
- [x] __Matrix Class__ (can also represent Vector)
    - [ ] Operators (via already realized Vector's ones)
    - [x] Ostream operator

    - [ ] Equations systems solvers (?)
        - [ ] Gauss
        - [ ] Other
        - [ ] ...
- [ ] __MakeFile__
  - [ ] Cmake (?)
- [ ] __Tests: Link to `CodeCov` or `Google tests`__
  - [x] Or at least start testing with `assert.h`
